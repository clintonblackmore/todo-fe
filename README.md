This is just a simple front-end TO DO app, created to test my knowledge of React and friends.

Ahem.

If you wish to run this project, you'll need a back end server.

- build and run [this one](https://github.com/hosseintalebi/node-todo-app) on localhost:3000
- or wait until we spin one up and change the `baseURL` in `src/sagas/index.js`.

With that done, go ahead and `npm start` this application. By default, it runs on http://localhost:3001 , and it also speaks to the React and Redux dev tools.

I'd love to hear your feedback.
